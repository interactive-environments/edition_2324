Power distribution for the exhibition system is 5V, designed around a custom keyed connector utilizing 3pin 2.56mm headers.
Devices on the network all have a socket, which is printed with a filament change at the last layer to get contrast on the polarity markings.
Ledbars have a socket on each end, and can also be used to conduct power along the WS2812 ledstrip inside. Future revision could run a dedicated power cable inside instead.

The power splitter boxes have 6 sockets, all soldered together inside, to be used to split power.

There's also a little holder for the ESP32 ToF nodes, to be screwed in to the top bar and connect to the same power network.
